        <h2>Difference between AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform</h2>
        <h3>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS)
        </h3>
        <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform which was introduced in 2002. It offers a wide range of cloud services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

            AWS provides the largest community with millions of active customers as well as thousands of partners globally. Most of the organizations use AWS to expand their business by moving their IT management to the AWS.
            
            Flexibility, security, scalability, and better performance are some important features of AWS.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Microsoft Azure
        </h3>

        <p>Microsoft Azure is also called as Windows Azure. It is a worldwide cloud platform which is used for building, deploying, and managing services. It supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Nodejs, C, and C#. The advantage of using Microsoft Azure is that it allows us to a wide variety of services without arranging and purchasing additional hardware components.

            Microsoft Azure provides several computing services, including servers, storage, databases, software, networking, and analytics over the Internet</p>

         <h3>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h3>  
         <p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is introduced by Google in 2011. It allows us to use Google's products such as Google search engine, Gmail, YouTube, etc. Most of the companies use this platform to easily build, move, and deploy applications on the cloud. It allows us to access these applications using a high-speed internet connection. The advantage of GCP is that it supports various databases such as SQL, MYSQL, Oracle, Sam, and more.

            Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides various cloud computing services, including computing, data analytics, data storage, and machine learning.</p> 
            <h3>
                Difference between AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)


            </h3>
            <p>
                Although AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google cloud platforms offer various high-level features in terms of computing, management, storage, and other services, but there are also some differences between these three.
